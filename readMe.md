## Day 9:
Completed video lectures on the following:
* Efficient Market Hypotheses (EMH)
* Types of EMH
* Accuracy of EMH
* Grinold's fundamental law of active portfolio management

## Day 10:
Watched video lectures about the following:
* Portfolio maximization using Markovitz's rule using covariance and plotting risk vs. returns of a portfolio
* The efficient frontier resulting from plotting the risk vs. returns of the stocks of a portfolio

## Day 11:
* Use of Machine Learning models at a hedge fund
* parametric regression models (linear & polynomial)
* k-nearest neighbors (avg 'y' values of k nearest points to a query)
* kernel regression (avg 'y' values of all data points)

## Day 12:

* Training & testing data
* Usage of ML libraries in python
* Example of a class that predicts based on chosen library

## Day 13:
* Assessing a ML model using metrics:
    1. RMSE
    2. Correlation
* Ensemble learners and how to build them
* Bagging and boosting
* Reinforcement Learning

## Day 14:
* Made a simple linear regression model to predict a 30-day amazon stock prices 
* Used a single variable linear regression
* Got and cleaned data from quandl API using python

## Day 15:
* Got and cleaned 5 stocks data from quandl using python API
* Chose a date range for analysis
* Cleaned the data and created a pandas dataframe for the portfolio

## Day 16:
* Did literature review and saw other code available online in various hackathons tackling the same issue
* Shortlisted and analyzed code sets that approach similar problems using Machine Learning

## Day 17:
* Created a problem statement 
* Sketched out an algorithm on how to approach my model

## Day 18:
* Normalized the stocks in my portfolio of 5 stocks
* Allocated a hypothetical investment value
* Assigned the value to the normalized protfolio
* Summed the values to get a day-end value of the portfolio 

## Day 19:
* Decided the variable indicators to include in the multi-variate linear regression equation:
    * Bollinger bands
    * Momentum
    * Simple Moving Average
    * P/E ratio

## Day 20:
* Documented my capstone proposal and suggested approach for final analysis 
* Submitted document containing roadmap for prediction in the online forum
